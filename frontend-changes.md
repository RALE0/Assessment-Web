# Frontend Authentication Integration - Changes Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines all the changes made to the frontend to integrate a complete authentication system. The authentication system includes user registration (sign up), login, logout, password reset functionality, session tracking, and protected routes.

## üîß Dependencies Added
The following dependencies are already available in the project and were utilized for the authentication system:
- `react-hook-form` + `@hookform/resolvers` - Form management and validation
- `zod` - Schema validation
- `@radix-ui/*` components - UI components (dropdown, avatar, etc.)
- `lucide-react` - Icons
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Data fetching (for future API integration)

## üìÅ New Files Created

### 1. Authentication Context
**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Centralized authentication state management
- **Features:**
  - User session management
  - User registration (sign up) functionality
  - Login/logout functionality
  - Password reset handling
  - Session activity logging
  - Token management with localStorage
  - Automatic session validation on app load

### 2. Authentication Page
**File:** `src/pages/Auth.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive authentication page with multiple modes
- **Features:**
  - **Sign Up Mode:** User registration form with username, email, password, and password confirmation
  - **Login Mode:** Username/password login form with validation
  - **Password Reset Mode:** Forgot password functionality
  - Password visibility toggle for both password fields
  - Form validation with Zod schemas including password confirmation matching
  - Seamless mode switching between sign up, login, and password reset
  - Responsive design matching app theme
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Spanish language interface

### 3. Protected Route Component
**File:** `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- **Purpose:** Route protection for authenticated users
- **Features:**
  - Redirects unauthenticated users to login
  - Loading state during authentication check
  - Preserves intended destination after login

## üìù Modified Files

### 1. App Component (`src/App.tsx`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added `AuthProvider` wrapper around the entire app
- Restructured routes to separate public and protected routes
- Integrated `ProtectedRoute` component for sensitive pages
- Added `/auth` route for authentication

**Route Structure:**
```
Public Routes:
- / (Index page)
- /about (About page)
- /auth (Authentication page)

Protected Routes:
- /dashboard (requires authentication)
- /recommendations (requires authentication)
- /analytics (requires authentication)
```

### 2. Header Component (`src/components/Header.tsx`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added authentication-aware navigation
- Integrated user dropdown menu with avatar
- Added logout functionality
- Login/logout buttons based on auth state
- Mobile-friendly authentication elements
- User profile display with username and email

**New Features:**
- User avatar with initials
- Dropdown menu for authenticated users
- Mobile authentication section
- Logout confirmation with toast notifications

### 3. API Services (`src/services/api.ts`)
**Changes Made:**
- Added authentication-related TypeScript interfaces
- Extended `CropRecommendationAPI` class with auth methods
- Added session tracking and logging capabilities

**New API Methods:**
- `login(credentials)` - User authentication
- `signup(credentials)` - User registration with automatic login
- `logout(token)` - Session termination
- `verifyToken(token)` - Token validation
- `resetPassword(request)` - Password reset request
- `logActivity(activity, token)` - Session activity logging
- `getSessionLogs(userId, token)` - Retrieve user session history

## üé® Design Integration

### Color Scheme & Styling
- Maintained consistent green/emerald gradient theme
- Used existing design patterns from Index page
- Implemented responsive design for all screen sizes
- Added hover effects and transitions consistent with app style

### UI Components Used
- `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardHeader` - Login form container
- `Button` - Various authentication actions
- `Input`, `Label` - Form fields
- `DropdownMenu` - User menu in header
- `Avatar`, `AvatarFallback` - User profile display
- `Alert` - Error message display

## üîê Security Features

### Frontend Security Measures
- Form validation with Zod schemas
- Secure token storage in localStorage
- Automatic token cleanup on logout
- Password field obfuscation with toggle
- Protected route redirection
- Session timeout handling

### Session Management
- Automatic session validation on app load
- Activity logging for security audit
- User session tracking with timestamps
- Graceful handling of expired sessions

## üåê Internationalization
All authentication UI is implemented in Spanish to match the existing application:
- "Crear Cuenta" (Sign Up)
- "Iniciar Sesi√≥n" (Login)
- "Cerrar Sesi√≥n" (Logout)
- "¬øOlvidaste tu contrase√±a?" (Forgot password?)
- "¬øNo tienes cuenta? Crear cuenta" (Don't have an account? Sign up)
- "¬øYa tienes cuenta? Iniciar sesi√≥n" (Already have an account? Sign in)
- Error and success messages in Spanish

## üì± Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach for authentication forms
- Responsive header with mobile menu integration
- Touch-friendly authentication elements
- Optimized for various screen sizes

## üöÄ Ready for Integration
The frontend is now fully prepared for backend integration. All API endpoints are configured and ready to connect to the authentication backend when implemented.

## üîÑ State Management Flow

### New User Registration Flow
```
1. User visits /auth and clicks "Crear cuenta"
2. User fills out sign up form (username, email, password, confirm password)
3. Form validation ensures password match and field requirements
4. AuthContext handles signup API call
5. On success, user is automatically logged in and redirected
6. Session activities are logged automatically
```

### Existing User Login Flow
```
1. User accesses protected route
2. ProtectedRoute checks authentication status
3. If not authenticated, redirect to /auth
4. User submits login form
5. AuthContext handles login API call
6. On success, user redirected to intended destination
7. Header updates to show authenticated state
8. Session activities are logged automatically
```

## üìã Testing Recommendations
Before backend integration:
1. Test all authentication UI components
2. Verify protected route behavior
3. Test responsive design on various devices
4. Validate form submission and error handling
5. Test session state persistence across page refreshes

## üîó Integration Points
The frontend is ready to connect with backend endpoints at `172.28.69.96:8443`:
- `POST /auth/signup` - User registration (NEW)
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /auth/verify` - Token verification
- `POST /auth/reset-password` - Password reset
- `POST /auth/log-activity` - Activity logging
- `GET /auth/sessions/:userId` - Session history

### Backend Configuration
- **Base URL:** `172.28.69.96:8443` (separate backend instance)
- **Environment Variable:** `VITE_API_BASE_URL=172.28.69.96:8443`
- **CORS:** Must be configured to allow frontend domain
